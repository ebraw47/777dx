# Website Improvements – SEO & Getting Impressions

This document suggests changes to improve search visibility and fix “0 impressions” in Google Search Console (GSC). It covers indexing, technical SEO, content, and promotion.

---

## 1. Why You Might See 0 Impressions

- **Site not indexed yet** – New or low-authority sites take time to be crawled and shown.
- **Wrong property in GSC** – You might be viewing `www` vs non-`www`, or `http` vs `https`. Add all variants and use the one that matches your canonical URLs.
- **Robots / noindex** – A single `noindex` or misconfigured `robots.txt` can block indexing.
- **No backlinks / no traffic** – Google discovers and ranks pages partly via links and usage; no links often means slow or no impressions.
- **Very competitive keywords** – Terms like “PK365 download” or “teen patti real money” are crowded; without strong signals you may get few or zero impressions.

## 2. Technical & Indexing Checks

### 2.1 Google Search Console

- Add and verify **all** URL variants: `https://pk365-app.pk`, `https://www.pk365-app.pk` (if you use www).
- Use **URL Inspection** on your homepage and 2–3 key URLs. Request indexing after fixing any issues.
- Check **Coverage / Pages**: see if pages are “Indexed”, “Discovered – currently not indexed”, or “Crawled – currently not indexed”. Fix errors and remove unnecessary blocks.
- Confirm **Sitemaps**: submit `https://pk365-app.pk/sitemap.xml` (or your dynamic sitemap URL). Ensure all important pages are listed and return 200.

### 2.2 Robots & Canonical

- In `robots.txt`: allow `/` and important paths; don’t block `/blog` or key landing pages.
- Every page should have a **canonical** tag pointing to the final URL (you already use `alternates.canonical` in metadata – keep it consistent).
- No `noindex` on the homepage or main landing pages unless intended.

### 2.3 Core Web Vitals & Mobile

- Run **PageSpeed Insights** and **Mobile-Friendly Test** for the homepage and a blog post. Fix large images, render-blocking resources, and layout shifts so the site is fast and mobile-friendly.
- Use Next.js Image (`next/image`) and correct `sizes` so images are optimized; you’re already using it – keep image sizes and formats (e.g. WebP) in check.

## 3. Content & Keyword Strategy

### 3.1 Reduce Plagiarism Risk (Done in This Pass)

- Homepage and several blog intros/sections were rewritten in a more original way so they don’t mirror other sites. Keep adding **your own** explanations, steps, and examples.
- Avoid copying blocks from other Teen Patti sites; rewrite in your voice and add unique details (e.g. exact steps, amounts, screens, Pakistan-specific notes).

### 3.2 Target Clear Queries

- **Informational**: “how to deposit in PK365”, “is PK365 safe”, “PK365 withdrawal time”.
- **Transactional**: “PK365 download”, “PK365 APK Pakistan”, “PK365 latest version”.
- Use one main keyword per page in title, meta description, and one H1. Keep titles under ~60 characters and descriptions under ~155 so they don’t get cut off in results.

### 3.3 Content Depth & Uniqueness

- Add **unique value**: comparison tables, step-by-step with exact button names, min/max amounts, screenshots (with alt text), FAQs that match real user questions.
- **Blog**: Publish new guides (e.g. “PK365 vs [other app]”, “How to fix login/OTP issues”, “JazzCash deposit not showing”). Update old posts with new info and dates.
- **Internal links**: Link from homepage and blog index to each important guide; link between related posts (e.g. deposit ↔ withdraw, account ↔ login). You already have some – expand deliberately.

---

## 4. Off-Site & Promotion

- **Backlinks**: Get links from Pakistani tech/gaming forums, WhatsApp groups (share useful guides), or relevant directories. Quality and relevance matter more than quantity.
- **Social**: Share new posts and the download page on Facebook, Twitter, or any platform your audience uses. Consistent sharing can lead to more visits and eventually more crawls and impressions.
- **Brand searches**: If people search “PK365apk” or “PK365 official”, a clear site name and consistent NAP (name, address, phone if you show them) help.

## 6. HowTo Schema, GEO & AEO (Applied)

The following are already in place to support **rich results**, **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**, and **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**:

### 6.1 HowTo Schema

- **Homepage**: HowTo “How to Download and Install PK365 APK on Android” in the `@graph` (5 steps, totalTime PT5M, url with #download).
- **Deposit page** (`/deposit-money-in-pk365`): HowTo + WebPage in `@graph` (7 steps, totalTime PT3M).
- **Withdraw page** (`/withdraw-money-from-pk365`): HowTo + WebPage in `@graph` (9 steps, totalTime PT5M).
- **Create account blog** (`/blog/create-PK365-account-and-login`): HowTo in `@graph` with BlogPosting (8 steps, totalTime PT2M).
- **How-to-use guide** (`/blog/how-to-use-PK365-app-pakistan-guide-2026`): HowTo “How to Use PK365 App in Pakistan” (6 steps, totalTime PT15M).

Reusable component: `src/components/HowToSchema.tsx` for future step-by-step pages.

### 6.2 GEO / Geo-Targeting

- **Organization** (layout + homepage): `areaServed: { "@type": "Country", "name": "Pakistan", "alternateName": "PK" }`, and `contactPoint.areaServed: "PK"`, `availableLanguage: ["English", "Urdu"]`.
- **WebSite** (homepage): `areaServed` for Pakistan.
- **Meta tags** (layout `<head>`): `geo.region` (PK), `geo.placename` (Pakistan) for crawlers that use geo meta.

### 6.3 AEO-Friendly Structure

- Guide pages use **WebPage** with `mainEntity` pointing to the **HowTo** (deposit, withdraw).
- **BlogPosting** + **HowTo** in same `@graph` where relevant (create-account, how-to-use).
- Clear **name**, **description**, **url**, **totalTime**, and **step** with `position`, `name`, `text` so answer engines can extract direct answers and steps.

## 7. Realistic Timeline

- **Indexing**: Can take from a few days to a few weeks after fixing technical issues.
- **Impressions**: Often 2–4 weeks or more before numbers move, especially in competitive niches.
- **Rankings**: Improve gradually as you add content, internal links, and a few backlinks.

Keep monitoring GSC (Coverage, Sitemaps, Performance) and refine titles/descriptions based on which queries start to get impressions and clicks. Validate HowTo and other schema with [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).
